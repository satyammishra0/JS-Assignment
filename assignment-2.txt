1. What is lexical structure?
2. What is Unicode?
3. Explain all the keywords present in the JavaScript with examples.
4. What are shorthand operators, explain with a suitable example?
5. What is “use Strict” in JavaScript?


1-
Lexical structure is just a set of ECMAScript standards to standardised the language and 
to define the set of instructions for the language. 
Ex. Variable name should not start with number . 
    Variable name should not start with - .
    Its not necessary to end the line with semicolon but its a good practice do so. 

2-
Unicode is a special value given to characters  in the form of code . The general syntax is \uXXXX.
where X are the numbers .

3-
var,let,CONST,if,else,if else,switch,for ,for each ,while ,do,String,array,type of ,class 

Reserved keywords
interface
public
private 
protected
implements
ENUM

4-
Shorthand operators are the short form given to the complex assignment operators to make the use case clear.
Ex.
Shorthand     Original assignment operators
x += y ====>>>x= x+y;
x -= y ====>>>x= x-y;

5-
It is a new feature in ECMAScript Which is used to instruct the browser to work in strict mode.
Ex.
test(10, 20);

function test(a, b) {
    add = a + b;
    console.log(a + b);
}

without use strict it works fine but in another case
"use strict";
test(10, 20);

function test(a, b) {
    add = a + b;
    console.log(a + b);
}
this throws an error
