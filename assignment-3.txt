Global object in JS is a global properties which are defined globally and it varies according to your environment. 
for example if we run our code in NODE NODE is the supreme global object while in BROWSER WINODW is a supreme global object. 
To avoid errors and other issues we should treat global objects as a reserved keywords.
some other global objects are like

Functions:: isNAN(),parseInt(),eval()
constructor:: date(),String(),object()
Constants Like:: undefined, NULL
